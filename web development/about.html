        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2S>
        <p>I am a passionate developer with a love for coding and creating innovative solutions.<br> My journey in the world of programming began 3 years ago when I enrolled for Information technology and first discovered<br> the power of writing code to bring ideas to life.</p>
        <p>Throughout my studies, I have honed my skills in various programming languages<br> and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can collaborate with diverse teams<br> to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful solutions.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest trends in technology,<br> exploring new frameworks and libraries, and engaging in continuous learning to broaden my skillset.<br> I am also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, <br>whether through mentoring, blogging, or contributing to open-source projects.</p>
